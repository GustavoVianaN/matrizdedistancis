variety of tasks to better understand their capabilities,', 'and 4) don’t underestimate the transformative potential of AI.Until recently,', 'the conventional wisdom was that while AI was better than humans at data-driven decision making tasks,', 'it was still inferior to humans for cognitive and creative ones.', 'But in the past two years language-based AI has advanced by leaps and bounds,', 'changing common notions of what this technology can do.', 'The most visible advances have been in what’s called “natural language processing” (NLP),', 'the branch of AI focused on how computers can process language like humans do.', 'It has been used to write an article for The Guardian,', 'and', 'AI-authored blog posts have gone viral — feats that weren’t possible a few years ago.', 'AI even excels at cognitive tasks like programming where it is able to generate programs for simple video games from human instructions.', 'Yet while these stunts may be attention grabbing,', 'are they really indicative of what this tech can do for businesses?The best known natural language processing tool is GPT-3,', 'from', 'OpenAI,', 'which uses AI and statistics to predict the next word in a sentence based on the preceding words', '.', 'NLP practitioners call tools like this “language models,', '”', 'and they can be used for simple analytics tasks,', 'such as classifying documents and analyzing the sentiment in blocks of text,', 'as well as more advanced tasks,', 'such as answering questions and summarizing reports', '.', 'Language models are already reshaping traditional text analytics,', 'but GPT-3 was an especially pivotal language model because,', 'at 10x larger than any previous model upon release,', 'it was the first large language model,', 'which enabled it to perform even more advanced tasks like programming and solving high school–level math problems', '.', 'The latest version,', 'called InstructGPT,', 'has been fine-tuned by humans to generate responses that are much better aligned with human values and user intentions,', 'and Google’s latest model shows further impressive breakthroughs on language and reasoning.', 'For businesses,', 'the three areas where GPT-3 has appeared most promising are writing,', 'coding,', 'and', 'discipline-specific reasoning.', 'OpenAI,', 'the Microsoft-funded creator of GPT-3,', 'has developed a GPT-3-based language model intended to act as an assistant for programmers by generating code from natural language input.', 'This tool,', 'Codex,', 'is already powering products like Copilot for Microsoft’s subsidiary GitHub and is capable of creating a basic video game simply by typing instructions.', 'This transformative capability was already expected to change the nature of how programmers do their jobs,', 'but models continue to improve — the latest from Google’s DeepMind AI lab,', 'for example,', 'demonstrates the critical thinking and logic skills necessary to outperform most humans in programming competitions.', 'Models like GPT-3 are considered to be foundation models — an emerging AI research area — which also work for other types of data such as images and video.', 'Foundation models can even be trained on multiple forms of data at the same time,', 'like OpenAI’s DALL·E 2,', 'which is trained on language and images to generate high-resolution renderings of imaginary scenes or objects simply from text prompts.', 'Due to their potential to transform the nature of cognitive work', ',', 'economists expect that foundation models may affect every part of the economy and could lead to

months.', 'Elicit is designed for a growing number of specific tasks relevant to research,', 'like summarization,', 'data labeling,', 'rephrasing,', 'brainstorming,', 'and', 'literature reviews.I’ve found — not surprisingly — that Elicit works better for some tasks than others.', 'Tasks like data labeling and summarization are still rough around the edges,', 'with noisy results and spotty accuracy,', 'but research from Ought and research from OpenAI shows promise for the future.', 'For example,', 'the rephrase task is useful for writing,', 'but the lack of integration with word processing apps renders it impractical for now.', 'Brainstorming tasks are great for generating ideas or identifying overlooked topics,', 'and despite the noisy results and barriers to adoption', ',', 'they are currently valuable for a variety of situations.', 'Yet,', 'of all the tasks Elicit offers,', 'I find the literature review the most useful.', 'Because Elicit is an AI research assistant,',

less time trying to find existing content relevant to my research questions because its results are more applicable than other,', 'more traditional interfaces for academic search like Google Scholar.', 'I am also beginning to integrate brainstorming tasks into my work as well,', 'and my experience with these tools has inspired my latest research,', 'which seeks to utilize foundation models for supporting strategic planning.', 'You are certainly aware of the value of data,', 'but you still may be overlooking some essential data assets if you are not utilizing text analytics and NLP throughout your organization.', 'Text data is certainly valuable for customer experience management and understanding the voice of the customer,', 'but think about other text data assets in your organization: emails,', 'analysts’ reports,', 'contracts,', 'press releases,', 'archives — even meetings and phone calls can be transcribed.', 'There is so much text data,', 'and you don’t need advanced models like GPT-3 to extract its value.', 'Hugging Face,', 'an NLP startup,', 'recently released AutoNLP,', 'a new tool that automates training models for standard text analytics tasks by simply uploading your data to the platform.', 'The data still needs labels,', 'but far fewer than in other applications.', 'Because many firms have made ambitious bets on AI only to struggle to drive value into the core business,', 'remain cautious to not be overzealous.', 'This can be a good first step that your existing machine learning engineers — or even talented data scientists — can manage.', 'To take the next step,', 'again,', 'identify your data assets.', 'Many sectors,', 'and', 'even divisions within your organization,', 'use highly specialized vocabularies.', 'Through a

just the beginning.', 'You need to start understanding how these technologies can be used to reorganize your skilled labor.', 'The next generation of tools like OpenAI’s Codex will lead to more productive programmers,', 'which likely means fewer dedicated programmers and more employees with modest programming skills using them for an increasing number of more complex tasks.', 'This may not be true for all software developers,', 'but it has significant implications for tasks like data processing and web development.', 'Right now tools like Elicit are just emerging,', 'but they can already be useful in surprising ways.', 'In fact,', 'the previous suggestion was inspired by one of Elicit’s brainstorming tasks conditioned on my other three suggestions.', 'The original suggestion itself wasn’t perfect,', 'but it reminded me of some critical topics that I had overlooked,', 'and I revised the article accordingly.', 'In organizations,', 'tasks like this can assist strategic thinking or scenario-planning exercises.', 'Although there is tremendous potential for such applications,', 'right now the results are still relatively crude,', 'but they can already add value in their current state.', 'The bottom line is that you need to encourage broad adoption of language-based AI tools throughout your business.', 'It is difficult to anticipate just how these tools might be used at different levels of your organization,', 'but the best way to get an understanding of this tech may be for you and other leaders in your firm to adopt it yourselves.', 'Don’t bet the boat on it because some of the tech may not work out,', 'but if your team gains a better understanding of what is possible,', 'then you will be ahead of the competition.', 'Remember that while current AI might not be poised to replace managers,', 'managers who understand AI are poised to replace managers who don’t.', 'Large foundation models like GPT-3 exhibit abilities to generalize to a large number of tasks without any task-specific training.', 'The recent progress in this tech is a significant step toward human-level generalization and general artificial intelligence that are the ultimate goals of many AI researchers,', 'including those at OpenAI and Google’s DeepMind.', 'Such systems have tremendous disruptive potential that could lead to AI-driven explosive economic growth,', 'which would radically transform business and society.', 'While you may still be skeptical of radically transformative AI like artificial general intelligence,', 'it is prudent for organizations’ leaders to be cognizant of early signs of progress due to its tremendous disruptive potential.', 'Consider that former Google chief Eric Schmidt expects general artificial intelligence in 10–20 years and that the UK recently took an official position on risks from artificial general intelligence.', 'Had organizations paid attention to Anthony Fauci’s 2017 warning on the importance of pandemic preparedness,', 'the most severe effects of the pandemic and ensuing supply chain crisis may have been avoided.', 'Ignoring the transformative potential of AI also carries risks,', 'and', 'similar to the supply chain crisis,', 'firms’ inaction or irresponsible use of AI could have widespread and damaging effects on society (e.g.,', 'increasing inequality or domain-specific risks from automation)', '.', 'However,', 'unlike the supply chain crisis,', 'societal changes from transformative AI will likely be irreversible and could even continue to accelerate.', 'Organizations should begin preparing now not only to capitalize on transformative AI,', 'but', 'to do their part to avoid undesirable futures and ensure that advanced AI is used to equitably benefit society.', 'Powerful generalizable language-based AI tools like Elicit are here,', 'and they are just the tip of the iceberg; multimodal foundation model-based tools are poised to transform business in ways that are still difficult to predict.', 'To

'This article will cover the basics of NLP to help you get started.', 'Read on or use the links below to “jump” to each section: Natural language processing (NLP) describes the interaction between human language and computers.', 'It’s a technology that many people use daily and has been around for years,', 'but is often taken for granted.', 'A few examples of NLP that people use every day are:', 'In any case,', 'the computer is able to identify the appropriate word,', 'phrase,', 'or', 'response by using context clues,', 'the same way that any human would.', 'Conceptually,', 'it’s a fairly straightforward technology.', 'Where NLP outperforms humans is in the amount of language and data it’s able to process.', 'Therefore,', 'its potential uses go beyond the examples above and make possible tasks that would’ve otherwise taken employees months or years to accomplish.', 'Human interaction is the driving force of most businesses.', 'Whether it’s a brick-and-mortar store with inventory or a large SaaS brand with hundreds of employees,', 'customers and companies need to communicate before,', 'during,', 'and after a sale.', 'That means that there are countless opportunities for NLP to step in and improve how a company operates.', 'This is especially true of large businesses that want to keep track of,', 'facilitate,', 'and', 'analyze thousands of customer interactions in order to improve their product or service.', 'It would be nearly impossible for employees to log and interpret all that data on their own,', 'but technologies integrated with NLP can help do it all and more.', 'There are a wide variety of different applications for NLP.', 'Below are just three different ways that companies can use the technology in their business.', 'NLP can be integrated with a website to provide a more user-friendly experience.', 'Features like spell check,', 'autocomplete,', 'and autocorrect in search bars can make it easier for users to find the information they’re looking for,', 'which in turn keeps them from navigating away from your site.', 'Chatbots are nothing new,', 'but advancements in NLP have increased their usefulness to the point that live agents no longer need to be the first point of communication for some customers.', 'Some features of chatbots include being able to help users navigate support articles and knowledge bases,', 'order products or services,', 'and', 'manage accounts.', 'Between social media,', 'reviews,', 'contact forms,', 'support tickets,', 'and', 'other forms of communication,', 'customers are constantly leaving feedback about the product or service.', 'NLP can help aggregate and make sense of all that feedback,', 'turning it into actionable insight that can help improve the company.', 'Wonderflow’s Useful Reviews tab inside The Wonderboard,', 'is especially useful for analyzing overall feedback:', 'In this area,', 'you can view your most useful reviews.', 'Wonderflow will then highlight the positive and negative statements in these reviews so you can quickly distill this information and evaluate how each of your products or services are perceived by customers.', 'Recently,', 'Wonderflow was selected by independent research firm Aragon Research as one of the companies making an impact in document analytics.', 'Check out the report here.', 'Below are a few real-world examples of the NLP uses discussed above.', 'Some of these examples are of companies who have made use of the technology in order to improve their product or service,', 'and some are actual software providers that make this technology accessible to businesses.', 'SourceSpell check is a form of NLP that everyone is used to by now.', 'It’s unobtrusive,', 'easy to use,', 'and', 'can reduce a lot of headaches for both users and agents alike.', 'Not every user is going to take the time to compose a grammatically perfect sentence when contacting a help desk or sales agent.', 'Salesforce knows this,', 'so they made sure their contact form was equipped with spell check to make users’ lives easier.', 'This also makes their employees’ lives easier,', 'too', '.', 'Error-ridden customer messages can be difficult to interpret,', 'leading to miscommunication and frustration for all involved.', 'SourceSearch autocomplete is another type of NLP that many people use on a daily basis and have almost come to expect when searching for something.', 'This is thanks in large part to pioneers like Google,', 'who have been using the feature in their search engine for years.', 'The feature is just as helpful on company websites.', 'Salesforce integrated the feature into their personal search engine.', 'Users interested in learning more about a topic or function of Salesforce’s product might know one keyword,', 'but maybe not the full term.', 'Search autocomplete will help them locate the correct information and answer their questions faster.', 'This helps cut down on the likelihood that they’ll become disinterested and navigate away from the site.', 'SourceIt’s easy to make mistakes when typing and not realize it.', 'If the search engine on a website doesn’t catch that mistake and instead shows no results,', 'then potential buyers might assume you don’t have the information or answers they’re looking for and may instead go to a competitor.', 'HubSpot reduces the chances this will happen by equipping their site’s search engine with an autocorrect feature.', 'It catches errors and displays the appropriate results without requiring users to take any additional steps,', 'the same way a Google search would.\\nSourceWith NLP,', 'autocomplete isn’t the only way businesses can upgrade their on-site search.', 'Klevu is a smart search provider that is powered by NLP but is also self-learning.', 'It works best for e-commerce because it learns by watching how shoppers interact with search on the store.', 'In addition to providing the basic autocomplete search function,', 'Klevu automatically adds
